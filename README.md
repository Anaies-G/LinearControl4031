# LinearControl4031

This repository contains my work for the Linear Control Systems course (LinearControl4031) this semester, presented by Dr. Hamidreza Taghirad. The course covered the stability of continuous-time linear control systems, with an emphasis on design and improvement techniques.

## Contents

This repository includes:

*   **Lecture Files:** Lecture notes and materials presented by Dr. Taghirad.
*   **Homework Assignments:** Solutions and code for all homework assignments.
*   **Course Project:** Files related to the final course project.
*   **Research Work:**  Any independent research or explorations related to the course.

## Code

All assignments and projects include MATLAB and LaTeX code.  Please see the individual directories for specific instructions and details.

## How to Use

To use the code in this repository, you will need the following:

1.  **MATLAB:** The MATLAB scripts require a working installation of MATLAB.  You can also use an online MATLAB compiler if you don't have MATLAB installed locally.

2.  **LaTeX Compiler:** The LaTeX documents require a LaTeX compiler.  Popular options include TeXworks, Overleaf (an online LaTeX editor), or other LaTeX distributions.

**Steps:**

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LinearControl4031.git`
2.  Navigate to the specific directory

    *   **MATLAB:**  Open the MATLAB scripts in MATLAB or your online compiler and run them.  Refer to the comments within the scripts for specific instructions.
    *   **LaTeX:** Open the `.tex` files in your LaTeX editor (TeXworks, Overleaf, etc.) and compile them to generate the PDF documents.
