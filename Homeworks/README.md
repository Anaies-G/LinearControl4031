## Homework Assignments

This section contains the solutions and supporting code for all homework assignments in the Linear Control Systems course. The assignments were designed to be both challenging and engaging, reinforcing the concepts covered in the lectures.

Each homework assignment was carefully prepared using LaTeX for clear and professional presentation. The solutions were then rigorously verified using MATLAB to ensure accuracy and validate the theoretical results. This process provided valuable hands-on experience with applying the course concepts to practical problems.

The homework assignments covered a wide range of topics, including:

*   System identification and modeling
*   Stability analysis using various techniques (e.g., Nyquist criterion, Routh-Hurwitz criterion, Bode plots)
*   Controller design and implementation (e.g., PID control, lead/lag compensation)

The combination of LaTeX for documentation and MATLAB for verification proved to be an effective approach, enhancing both the clarity of the solutions and the confidence in their correctness.
