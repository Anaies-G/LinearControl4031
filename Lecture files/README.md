## Lecture Files

This section contains the lecture materials presented by Dr. Hamidreza Taghirad for the Linear Control Systems course. The lectures provided a comprehensive foundation in the analysis and design of linear control systems, with a particular emphasis on system stability.

Dr. Taghirad dedicated a significant portion of the lectures to various methods for analyzing system stability. These included both time-domain and frequency-domain techniques, providing a well-rounded understanding of stability analysis. Some of the key topics covered include:

*   **Time-Domain Analysis:** Examining the system's response to various inputs (e.g., step input, ramp input) to determine stability and performance characteristics.
*   **Frequency-Domain Analysis:** Utilizing techniques like Bode plots and the Nyquist criterion to assess stability based on the system's frequency response.

A particularly helpful aspect of the lectures was the introduction of simplified methods for constructing Nyquist plots using Bode plot data. This approach significantly streamlined the process and made frequency-domain analysis more accessible.

The lectures also covered various controller design techniques. While the material presented a solid introduction to controller design, it served more as a starting point, igniting a desire to delve deeper into the subject. The content provided a strong foundation upon which to build further knowledge and explore more advanced control design methodologies. It definitely sparked a thirst for further learning in this area.
