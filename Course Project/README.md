## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis, design, and implementation of linear control systems. Throughout this project, I applied theoretical concepts learned in the Linear Control Systems course to solve practical problems and gain hands-on experience in control system engineering.

The project is divided into several key stages:

### 1. System Identification

In the initial phase, I worked on identifying the dynamics of a given system based on input-output data. This process involved techniques similar to those used in machine learning, where the goal is to predict the system's behavior from observed data.

### 2. Stability Analysis

Next, I analyzed the stability of the identified system using various methods, including:

*   **Nyquist Criterion:**  A frequency-domain technique to assess stability based on the system's open-loop frequency response.
*   **Routh-Hurwitz Criterion:** An algebraic method to determine stability by examining the coefficients of the system's characteristic equation.
*   **Step Response Analysis:**  Examining the system's response to a sudden change in input to evaluate stability and performance characteristics.
*   **Bode Plot Analysis:**  Using Bode plots to analyze the system's frequency response and stability margins.

### 3. Controller Design

In the final stage, I designed controllers to meet specific performance requirements. This involved utilizing various control design techniques to achieve desired specifications, such as:

*   **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control:**  A widely used control strategy to adjust the system's response based on error, integral of error, and derivative of error.
*   **Lead/Lag Compensation:**  Frequency-domain techniques to improve the system's stability and transient response.

## Tools and Technologies

*   **MATLAB:**  All analysis and design tasks were conducted using MATLAB.
*   **Sisotool:**  I leveraged MATLAB's Sisotool for interactive controller design and analysis.
*   **Simulink:**  System simulations were performed using Simulink to validate the controller performance.
*   **LaTeX:**  All reports and documentation were prepared using LaTeX.
